Built an ongoing personal collection of experimental compilers, one for each letter of the alphabet, named after a world city. Each explores different ideas in language design, \acr{IR} construction, optimizations, and run-time. Targeted backends include \acr{LLVM IR}, \acr{MLIR}, \acr{NVPTX} for \acr{CUDA}.  All in C++.
