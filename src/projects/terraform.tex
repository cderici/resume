{\small\bodytext{A Terraform provider that enables integration with \myhref{https://github.com/juju/juju}{Juju} while managing Terraform environments. I implemented new resources and features (e.g., \myhref{https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/manual-provisioning-on-aws-using-terraform-juju-provider/10989}{manual provisioning on \acr{AWS}}), migrated the provider from the sdk2 to the provider framework (e.g., \myhref{https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/pull/264}{sample PR}), and maintained release cadence of new versions. All in Go.}}
