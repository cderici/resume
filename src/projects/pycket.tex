{\myhref{http://github.com/pycket/pycket}{Pycket: A tracing \textsc{JIT} compiler for full-scale Racket}}
{}
{\small\bodytext{

Built the first tracing \acr{JIT} capable of running a self-hosting language on a meta-tracing \acr{JIT} backend, and worked on it \myhref{https://github.com/pycket/pycket/graphs/contributors?from=8\%2F21\%2F2015\&to=9\%2F13\%2F2025}{for over five years} during PhD. Created a new \acr{IR} and implemented \myhref{https://github.com/cderici/trace-draw}{performance analysis tools}, run-time optimizations, and \myhref{https://github.com/cderici/abstract-machine-interp}{formalisms} to improve throughput. Added code-gen for the \textsc{FFI} layer, engines, and meta-continuations for user threads. Used Python, C++, and Racket.
