{}
{\small\bodytext{

PhD thesis project. Developed and maintained Pycket for over five years, designing the compiler to bootstrap the entire Racket language on a meta-tracing \acr{JIT} backend. Contributed to a new \acr{IR} (linklets, see publications) for a more portable Racket. Built \myhref{https://github.com/cderici/trace-draw}{performance analysis tools} and \myhref{https://github.com/cderici/abstract-machine-interp}{formalisms} to improve meta-tracing efficiency. Implemented run-time optimizations, preemption for threads, full FFI for  data structures, and primitives.
