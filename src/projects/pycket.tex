{\myhref{http://github.com/pycket/pycket}{Pycket: A tracing \textsc{JIT} compiler for full-scale Racket}}
{}
{\small\bodytext{
Developed and maintained \myhref{https://github.com/pycket/pycket/graphs/contributors?from=8\%2F21\%2F2015\&to=9\%2F13\%2F2025}{for over five years}. Designed the compiler to self-host a language on a meta-tracing \acr{JIT} backend. Contributed designing a new \acr{IR} (see publications). Built \myhref{https://github.com/cderici/trace-draw}{performance analysis tools}, run-time optimizations, and \myhref{https://github.com/cderici/abstract-machine-interp}{formalisms} to improve performance. Implemented code-gen for full \textsc{FFI} layer, and engines with meta-continuations for preemption for green threads. In Python, C, and Racket.
