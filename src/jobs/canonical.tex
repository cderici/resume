\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and maintained \myhref{https://github.com/juju/juju}{Juju}, an eventually consistent distributed orchestration system used by \textasciitilde200 companies globally, capable of handling 1000+-node workloads with 99.9\% availability on any infrastructure (Kubernetes or otherwise) across various cloud providers (e.g., \acr{AWS}, \acr{GCE}). All in Go.
  \item Improved reliability and fault tolerance by implementing edge machine services on relational \acr{DQL}ite back-end, migrating from No\acr{SQL} Mongo\acr{DB} (e.g., \myhref{https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/17767}{sample \acr{PR}}).
  \item Owned client libraries for three years--\myhref{https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju/graphs/contributors?from=8\%2F31\%2F2021\&to=7\%2F15\%2F2024}{python-libjuju}, \myhref{https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/graphs/contributors?from=5\%2F22\%2F2021\&to=12\%2F17\%2F2023}{Terraform Juju Provider}; doubled active users and maintained a steady release cadence.
  \item Took part in roadmap planning, coordinated cross-team work; mentored junior engineers, and improved hiring by creating a structured bootcamp process that cut down onboarding new engineers from 6 months to 1 month.

% Worked on distributed cloud orchestration system handling 1000+ node workloads across multiple regions with 99.9\% availability. Primarily in Go, and Python.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Architected full-stack distributed components, improved reliability, fault tolerance, back-pressure handling on an eventually consistent backend.
%     \item Doubled the user base of client libraries \myhref{https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju/}{Python-libjuju}, \myhref{https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/}{Terraform Juju Provider}), owned all deliverables for 3 years, and maintained release cadence.
%     \item Helped transition \myhref{https://github.com/juju/juju}{Juju}'s data model from No\acr{SQL} Mongo\acr{DB} to relational \acr{DQL}ite (e.g., \myhref{https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/17767}{sample \acr{PR}}).
%     \item Helped re-design the facade-based \acr{RPC} \acr{API} and developed a \acr{REST} \acr{API} alternative with Open\acr{API}.
%     \item Took part in roadmap planning, cross-team coordination, mentoring junior engineers, and hiring.
